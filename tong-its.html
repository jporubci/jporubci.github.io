								<h3>What is Tong-its?</h3>
								<p>Tong-its is a turn-base 3-player card game that uses the standard 52-card deck of French-suited playing cards. Aces are low cards worth 1 point. Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 10 points. All other cards are worth the same number of points as their rank. Tong-its is about creating sets and runs of cards to empty your hand or just lower the number of points your hand is worth.</p>
								<h3><br>How it works</h3>
								<p>First, some definitions.</p>
								<p>A `set` of cards is three or four cards of the same rank.</p>
								<p>A `run` of cards is three or more cards of the same suit and consecutive rank. The order of ranks is Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King.</p>
								<p>A `meld` is a set or a run.</p>
								<p>`Expose` is an action that a player can perform on a meld in their hand. Exposing a meld means placing the cards that make up the meld face-up in front of you.</p>
								<p>`Draw` is an action that a player may perform (not to be confused with `draw`ing a card). The action `draw` will typically be used in the phrase `call a draw` so as to avoid confusion. You should call a draw if you believe that the unmelded cards in your hand sum up to the least number of points among the players with at least one exposed meld.</p>
								<p>`Lay off` is an action that a player can perform with a card in their hand on a meld. If you have a card that can be added to an exposed meld, you may lay it off. If you lay off a card on someone else's meld, they will be restricted from calling a draw during their upcoming turn.</p>
								<p>`Challenge` and `fold` are actions that a player may perform in response to a draw.</p>
								<p>While these are the basic terms required to understand how the game is played, the extended rules of the game can be found in the README.md on the GitHub repository linked above.</p>
								<h3><br>Features</h3>
								<p>My Tong-its is a game that uses a terminal user interface. It is 100% functional and allows players to connect through the student machines at the University of Notre Dame to play online! There are two main functional states in this program: the lobby state and the game state. First, I'd like to focus on the lobby state.</p>
								<h3><br>The Lobby State</h3>
								<p>Designing the lobby state was very difficult, but I'm very proud of how it turned out. There are many issues that I personally have with the way many lobby states are designed in modern games. The purpose of a lobby is to match players. Many games design a system for doing this entirely behind the scenes, however I wanted friends to be able to play with one another, so I wanted my lobby state to be more manual. One important thing to note is that this program uses peer-to-peer communication in order to eliminate the need for a central server/host to be constantly running. This was important because it affected my implementation of the lobby and game state tremendously.</p>
								<p>The problem I have with many existing lobby states is that once you join a lobby, you cannot see the list of other lobbies without leaving your current lobby. Since the purpose of the lobby state is to find a group of players to play the game, players typically want to find other players quickly. A player looking to find a game quicker will join a fuller lobby over an emptier lobby. If you suspect that your lobby is emptier relative to the rest of the lobbies, you will have to leave your current lobby to see if you should join another lobby. But this results in players constantly leaving and rejoining lobbies to check the status of the lobbies. A better solution would be for the list of lobbies to be visible, along with the number of players in each lobby, at all times.</p>
								<p>But there is still a problem. How do you know the list of lobbies is up to date? What if you see a lobby that's almost full, and you're hosting an emptier lobby? You would want to leave your lobby and join the other one, but imagine that you do so, and someone else joins the other lobby before you. Now the lobby is full, and you lost all the players that were in your lobby, meaning you have to start from scratch again. This is where making the lobbies update in realtime comes in.</p>
								<p>If the lobbies updated in realtime, you'd have the most up-to-date information on the status of all the lobbies at any given point in time, allowing you to make the most educated decisions possible when attempting to join up for a game. This required designing the lobby state to listen to user input without blocking. If the program blocked, it would be unable to update the display to show new updates to lobbies and their statuses. I learned how to use the socket, asyncio, and curses modules to make the lobby interface non-blocking across network communications and input reads. I made lobbies update for everyone looking for a game in realtime. Among other things, I also designed the system to be resilient. Hosts are required to ping the name server every so often to signal that they are not dead. From the players' perspective, any host's lobby that has not pinged the name server for a certain period of time is considered disconnected. Players are kicked from the lobby and the hosted lobby is filtered out from the list of displayed lobbies. All of this is designed to ensure that lobbies are up-to-date, hosts are connected, and all players are able to make informed decisions when looking for a game.</p>
								<h3><br>The Game State</h3>
								<p>Programming the actual game state was the other challenging aspect of this project, but it was just as much of an adventure as the lobby state. The networking and communications logistics are all handled in the lobby state, so in the game state, I was able to focus purely on the game logic. Since this game uses peer-to-peer network communication, the lobby host receives all players' messages and actions, redistributes the global gamestate to all its players. In this way, everyones' game states are synchronized.</p>
								<h3><br>Challenges</h3>
								<p>The majority of the challenges were encountered when designing the lobby state. The lobby state went through multiple reworks and overhauls before I settled on a design I was very content with. Initially, it did not update in realtime, and users had to enter a refresh command in order to update the list of lobbies. While this would have been good enough, I wanted to take this lobby state to another level and design it with coroutines that would make it more expandable and scalable for future updates.</p>
								<p>The most annoying problem I faced was working with the curses module. It made everything so difficult because handling uncooked input can mess up the entire terminal even after terminating the program. To make the entire system safe, I use the curses wrapper, but this made it difficult to wrap the lobby state and the game state fluidly with one another. Nonetheless, I managed to resolve all of the main challenges I faced. I have created a TODO list on the README.md of the repository, and I've also included a list of potential ideas for future improvements to the program.</p>
								<h3><br>Future Improvements</h3>
								<p>Though I am busy currently with school (and applying for jobs), I do have ideas on how to improve the program. It is listed in the README.md on the repository. I have also included a list of rejected ideas for things I believe would actually worsen the program, in my opinion.</p>
